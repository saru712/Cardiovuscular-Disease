## Cardiovuscular-Disease Prediction 

According to World Health Organisation,

CVDs are the number 1 cause of death globally i.e More people die annually from CVDs than from any other cause. An estimated 17.9 million people died from CVDs in 2016, representing 31% of all global deaths. Of these deaths, 85% are due to heart attack and stroke

From the above facts and figures, we can easily conclude that Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for the majority of death and hospitalization, health care expenditures and loss of productivity in developed country
